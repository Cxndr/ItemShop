 - variable shop objects item
 - magic pot: place on shop counter, clicking it activates shop edit mode.
	- menu for this.
 - ledger: place on shop counter, clicking it shows shop records.
 - make npc pathing browse choice more efficient. instead of using a while statement to reloop when we find
	false reading. Just make a list of all viable locations and pick from there. Can just do a loop to check
	location viability once. Much cleaner implementation and much more efficient overhead.
 - switch editmode to a struct based system instead of objects (see note in tep event).
 - make objects we need to activate via player a child of obj_activatable. this way we can handle the
	activation in the object and have code there rather than all inside the player object.
 - we are currently using built-in camera and viewport to do window effect. can we create and use our
	own camera object instead? just record application surface section and set to new surface. draw that
	surface at the window.
 
 [ LATER ]
 - *poof* animation when placing interiors
 - obj_menu_inventory: what if we have nothing in inventory? category checks fail atm.
